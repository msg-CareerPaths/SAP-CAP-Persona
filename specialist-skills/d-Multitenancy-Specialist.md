# Multitenancy Specialist

Multitenancy is the ability to serve multiple tenants (i.e., clients using SaaS solutions) through single clusters of micro service instances, while ensuring strict isolation with respect to tenantsâ€™ data and access to it. This specialization focuses on fundamental concepts of multitenancy, underpinning SaaS solutions in CAP.
