# Persona *Captain*

## Who is the *Captain*?

The *Captain* is new to the SAP world and very interested in cloud development.

The *Captain* wants to focus on cloud application programming within S/4HANA and the BTP, therefore the **Captain** wants to get her/his hands dirty with the new Cloud Application Programming Model (*CAP*) and everything surrounding it.

## What is the *Captain* capable of?

When the *Captain* has finished the first three major steps of the given Learning Path, the *Captain* is able to get staffed in upcoming development projects (customer or product). The *Captain* already has basic knowledge in all of the needed skills and is looking forward to get project experience in order to deepen her/his knowledge. This is important as the *Captain* has no real “expert knowledge” yet – therefore it is a must-have to also have an experienced lead developer in the project as well, who helps navigating and taking the first journey in “real life.”
