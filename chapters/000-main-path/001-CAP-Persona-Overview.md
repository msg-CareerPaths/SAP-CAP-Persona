# Persona *Captain*

## Who is the *Captain*?

![The Captain](https://github.com/msg-CareerPaths/sap-cap-persona/blob/main/assets/The%20Captain.png?raw=true)

The *Captain* is new to the SAP world and very interested in cloud development.The *Captain* wants to focus on cloud application programming within S/4HANA and the BTP, therefore the *Captain* wants to get her/his hands dirty with the new Cloud Application Programming Model (*CAP*) and everything surrounding it.

## What is the *Captain* capable of?

When the *Captain* has finished the first three major steps of the given Learning Path, the *Captain* is able to get staffed in upcoming development projects (customer or product). The *Captain* already has basic knowledge in all of the needed skills and is looking forward to get project experience in order to deepen her/his knowledge. This is important as the *Captain* has no real “expert knowledge” yet – therefore it is a must-have to also have an experienced lead developer in the project as well, who helps navigating and taking the first journey in “real life.”

## Why does msg need more *Captains*?

For msg, it is important to have many developers that are *Captains*. As more and more applications run entirely in the cloud, CAP is *the skill* to invest for programming cloud-native applications. Upcoming projects that focus on cloud applications that run on the SAP BTP will be primarily implemented with CAP in the back-end, therefore it is crucial for msg to have a lot of *Captains*.

## Why do you want to become a *Captain*?

If you are new to the SAP world (or at least to cloud application programming), it is important to have SAP’s future strategy in mind. If you become a *Captain*, you are prepared for the next years (maybe even decades) of back-end development in the SAP ecosystem. Team leads of upcoming projects will fight for you to make sure that you will be part of their development team.​
